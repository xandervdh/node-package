# what is this?
A extra excersize from the cource I am following.
 
I needed to make a package.json and make it work.

# how does it work?
1. clone the repository.
2. open a terminal and go to the local repository
3. type "npm install" and enter
4. type "npm run build" and enter
5. open the index.html and look at the result
6. if you make any changes to the index.js file do step 4 again to see the results
